You are given an integer array A.

Decide whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more subarrays of even length such that the first and last element of all subarrays will be even.

Return "YES" if it is possible; otherwise, return "NO" (without quotes).


string Solution::solve(vector<int> &A) {
    int i=0,n=A.size(),count=0;
    if(n==0 || n==1){
        return "NO";
    }

    if(n%2==0 && A[0]%2==0 && A[n-1]%2==0){
      return "YES";
    }
    else{
        return "NO";
    }
}

Approach: To divide an arry into even length subarrays it must be of even length also if start and end elements re not even then it is not posiible to have all arrays ending an starting with even numbers.
