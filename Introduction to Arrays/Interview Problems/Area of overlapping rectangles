Problem Description
Given eight integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, which represent two rectangles in a 2D plane.

For the first rectangle, its bottom left corner is (A, B), and the top right corner is (C, D), and for the second rectangle, its bottom left corner is (E, F), and the top right corner is (G, H).

Find and return the overlapping area of the two rectangles.


int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
int xdist=min(C,G)-max(A,E);
int ydist=min(H,D)-max(F,B);
if(xdist<0 || ydist<0){
    return 0;
}
return xdist*ydist;
}
