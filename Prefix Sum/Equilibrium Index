You are given an array A of integers of size N.

Your task is to find the equilibrium index of the given array

The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

1 <= N <= 105
-105 <= A[i] <= 105

Brute Force 

for each i , iterate from i-1 to 0 for left sum nd i+1 to n for right.

Better Solution
TC:O(N) SC:O(N)
By Prefix Sum,we get sum from 0 to i-1 by using prefix[i-1] and i+1 to n by prefix[n-1]-prefix[i].

Efficient use rightsum=0 and leftsum=0.

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[] A) {
       int i=0,n=A.length,sum=0;
       for(i=0;i<n;i++){
         sum+=A[i];
        }
        int leftsum=0;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++){
           sum-=arr[i];
           if(sum==leftsum){
             return i;
            }
           leftsum+=arr[i];
        }
       }
      }
