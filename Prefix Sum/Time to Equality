Problem Description
Given an integer array A of size N. In one second, you can increase the value of one element by 1.

Find the minimum time in seconds to make all elements of the array equal.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000

//Approach: We can only increase the elements of the array, thus the minimum requirement shall be for all elements to be equal to max element. \
//Thus have subtracted the total sum from n*maxxelement to get how much more is to be added to the sum.

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[] arr) {
        int i=0,sum=0,n=arr.length,maxx=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++){
          sum+=arr[i];
          maxx=Math.max(arr[i],maxx);
        }
        return maxx*n-sum;
        
    }
}
