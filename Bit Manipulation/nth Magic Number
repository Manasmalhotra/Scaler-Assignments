Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.

A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.

First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.

Approach : Represent A in binary representation if ith bit is set add 5^i.


int Solution::solve(int A) {
    int x=1,ans=0;
    while(A>0){
       x=x*5;
       if(A&1==1){
           ans+=x;
       }
       A=A>>1;
    }
    return ans;
}
