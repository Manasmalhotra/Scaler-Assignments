Problem Description
Given an array of integers A, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

int Solution::singleNumber(const vector<int> &A) {
int i,n=A.size(),ans=0;

for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    ans=ans^A[i];
}

return ans;
}
