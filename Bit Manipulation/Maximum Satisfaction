Problem Description
Given an array of integers A of size N denoting the quality of the fruits. A[i] represents the fruit quality of the ith fruit.

Shaun needs to pick four fruits, but he needs to pick them so that his satisfaction value will be maximum.

If a, b, c, and d are fruit quality of the four fruits picked, then the satisfaction value(a, b, c, d) = (a & b & c & d) where & is bitwise AND operator.

Find the maximum satisfaction value Shaun can obtain

Problem Constraints
4 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 109



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format
Return the maximum satisfaction value Shaun can obtain.

Approach: It is a fact that we will get the maximum result when the most significant bit is set. Therefore for each bit starting 31 check if we have numbers>=4 
with that bit set then make nother numbers=0 so that they cannot influence the answer now as they are not giving the max answer.

00110000-B
00100000-C
00111000-D
00000100-E
00001001-F

Here if E and F are not made zero they can influence the answer later on.

        for(j=0;j<n;j++){
            if(((A[j]>>i)&1)==1){
                count+=1;
            }
        }
        if(count>=4){
            ans=ans+(1<<i);
            for(j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(((A[j]>>i)&1)==0){
                    A[j]=0;
                }
            }
        }
