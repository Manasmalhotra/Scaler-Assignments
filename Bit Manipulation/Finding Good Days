Problem Description
Alex has a cat named Boomer. He decides to put his cat to the test for eternity.

He starts on day 1 with one stash of food unit, every next day, the stash doubles.

If Boomer is well behaved during a particular day, only then she receives food worth equal to the stash produced on that day.

Boomer receives a net worth of A units of food. What is the number of days she received the stash?

Approach: Here you can see that the food doubles on each day.. And we have to find the number of days Boomer was well behaved.
So a common observation here is that food on ith day = 2^i.
So w eneed to check if bits of the binary number are set or unset to get answer.

TC: O(LOG A)

int Solution::solve(int A) {
    int count=0;
    while(A){
        if(A&1==1){
            count+=1;
        }
        A=A>>1;
    }
    return count;
}
