Problem Description
Construct a binary number having A 1's followed by B 0's. Return the decimal value of that binary number.
For eg -
A = 3, B = 2
Answer = (11100)2 . Return = 28

int Solution::solve(int A, int B) {
    return ((1<<A)-1)<<B;
}

We get A ones by pow(2,A)-1 always, then left shift the number to get the required 0s.
