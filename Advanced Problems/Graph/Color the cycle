Problem Description
Given the number of vertices A in a Cyclic Graph.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the graph so that no two Adjacent vertices have the same color.


A cyclic graph with A vertices is a graph with A edges, such that it forms a loop. See example test case explanation for more details.

By observation we can say that a cycle with odd vertices can be colored through 3 colors and the one with even vetices can be colored using two.

int Solution::solve(int A) {
    if(A%2==0){
        return 2;
    }
    return 3;
}
