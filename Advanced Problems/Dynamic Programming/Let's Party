Problem Description

In Danceland, one person can party either alone or can pair up with another person.

Can you find in how many ways they can party if there are A people in Danceland?

Note: Return your answer modulo 10003, as the answer can be large.

Approach:
Either one person can party alone and we can arrange remaining A-1 people or we can pair up kth person with any person from [1,k-1] and then solve for A-2 people.

Recursive

int ways(int A){
    if(A<=1){
        return 1;
    }
    return (ways(A-1)+ (A-1)*ways(A-2))%10003;
}
int Solution::solve(int A) {
    return ways(A);
}

Bottom up

int Solution::solve(int A) {
    vector<int>dp(A+1,0);
    dp[0]=0;
    dp[1]=1;
    dp[2]=2;
    long long mod=10003;
    for(int i=3;i<=A;i++){
        dp[i]=(dp[i-1]%mod+(1LL*(i-1)*dp[i-2])%mod)%mod;
    }
    return dp[A];  
}
