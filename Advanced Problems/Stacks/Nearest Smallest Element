Problem Description
Given an array A, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.

More formally,

G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that

j is maximum possible AND

j < i AND

A[j] < A[i]

Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider the next smaller element as -1.


6 1 4 5 3 2 0
Looks for elements like 6 is first element so -1. Since 6>1 pop 6 as now it cannot be the nearest smaller element for any element as if num>6 then it is natural num>1.

Time Complexity:O(N)

vector<int> Solution::prevSmaller(vector<int> &A) {
    int i,n=A.size();
    stack<int>s;
    vector<int>result;

    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
       while(!s.empty() && s.top()>=A[i]){
           s.pop();
       }
       if(!s.empty()){
           result.push_back(s.top());
       }
       else{
           result.push_back(-1);
       }
       s.push(A[i]);
    }
    return result;
}
