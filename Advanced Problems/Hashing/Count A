Approach:
Number of subarrays Calculation.
How we calculate number of subarrays?
We take each start point and thens ee number of end points for it.
By these combinations below we understand that as the index goes on inceasing by 1 the number o end pts available also decrease.
abc
0: 0,1,2
1: 1,2
2: 2
3+2+1=6

Then in counting number of subarrays for 'a' we consider only those start and points which have a. This results in answer as count(a)*(count(a)+1)/2. 

aaba
Number of start points: 3
0  0,1,2
1  1,2
2  2

abaacaan
0 0,2,3,5,6
2 2,3,5,6
3 3,5,6
5 5,6
6 6


int Solution::solve(string A) {
    int i=0,n=A.length(),count=0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(A[i]=='a'){
            count+=1;
        }
    }
    return (count*(count+1))/2;
}
