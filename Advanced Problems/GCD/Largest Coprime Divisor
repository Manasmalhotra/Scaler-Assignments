Problem Description

You are given two positive numbers A and B . You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1

Approach : 120= 3*5*2*2*2 50=5*5*2 ==> 12=3*2*2 50=5*5*2 ==>6=3*2 25=5*5;return 6 since now A does not have anything in common with B

int gcd(int a,int b){
    if(b==0){
        return a; 
    }
    return gcd(b,a%b);
}

int Solution::cpFact(int A, int B) {
    while(gcd(A,B)!=1){// while loop because it is possible that for some common prime factor, the power of factor in A can be greater than that in B so it will take multiple rounds to break this common link.
        A=A/gcd(A,B);
    }
    return A;
}
