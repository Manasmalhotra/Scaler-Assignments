Problem Description
Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.

Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell the number of special integers less than or equal to A.

//Approach: Simple. As nos have to be divisible by both a and b so they have to be divisible by their lcm.

int Solution::solve(int A, int B, int C) {
    long lcm = (C * B) / __gcd(C, B);
    if (lcm > A)
        return 0;
    int ans = A / lcm;
    return ans;
}
